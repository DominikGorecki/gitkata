# gitkata
A Kata to practice some GIT fundamentals. Please FORK and follow the instructions. 
1. Fork this repo (FORK button in the top right)
2. Clone your forked repository to your local machine. 
> If you haven't set up SSH with github, ensure you select the "Clone with HTTPS" button. This Kata will not go through setting up SSH because I wanted it to be applicable to Windows, Linux, and Mac users. Since Setting up SSH in Windows is more difficult (at least different) than setting it up on Linux/Mac, we stay away from it here.
```git clone https://github.com/_____/gitkata.git```
